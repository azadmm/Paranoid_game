# Paranoid_game
A simple paranoid game in the C programming language

This is a simple project that I created as part of my course about C programming language.

This project creates a simple paranoid game where you have a ball and your job is to break the bricks. 
Whenever you destroy a brick you will get score.

Cheers! Enjoy...
